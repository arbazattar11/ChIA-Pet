# Step 1: Quality Control
fastqc -o qc_reports/ *.fastq

# Step 2: Read Alignment
bwa index reference_genome.fa
bwa mem -t 4 reference_genome.fa sample1.fastq sample2.fastq > aligned_reads.sam

# Step 3: Mapping Filtering
# Filter out unmapped reads, PCR duplicates, and low-quality mappings
samtools view -F 4 -q 30 -bS aligned_reads.sam | samtools sort -o sorted_reads.bam

# Step 4: Peak Calling (Optional)
# ChIA-PET does not typically involve peak calling as in ChIP-seq analysis

# Step 5: Interaction Calling
# Identify chromatin interactions using ChIA-PET specific algorithms
chiasig -i sorted_reads.bam -o interactions.bed

# Step 6: Annotation and Visualization
# Annotate and visualize the identified interactions
annotatePeaks.pl interactions.bed hg38 > annotated_interactions.txt
plotProfile -m sorted_reads.bam -out profile.pdf

# Step 7: Differential Interaction Analysis (Optional)
# Perform if comparing between different experimental conditions

# Step 8: Functional Enrichment Analysis
# Perform functional enrichment analysis of interacting regions using external tools

# Step 9: Visualization and Interpretation
# Visualize and interpret the identified chromatin interactions
